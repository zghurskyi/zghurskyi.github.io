It is unacceptable for the component under stress to fail catastrophically or to drop messages in an uncontrolled fashion. Since it can’t cope and it can’t fail it should communicate the fact that it is under stress to upstream components and so get them to reduce the load. This back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than collapse under it. The back-pressure may cascade all the way up to the user, at which point responsiveness may degrade, but this mechanism will ensure that the system is resilient under load, and will provide information that may allow the system itself to apply other resources to help distribute the load.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s illustrate the context, that requires to apply back-pressure.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/backpressure.png"><img src="/images/backpressure.png" alt="backpressure"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>So, essentially the problem here is the mismatch in throughput between services.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Strategies to deal with throughput mismatch</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Once you are in the situation described above, essentially you have following choices:</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>(Auto-)Scale</strong> service, that is under pressure</p></li><li><p><strong>Drop down or sample</strong> incoming requests, once service under pressure is saturated</p></li><li><p><strong>Buffer</strong> requests</p></li><li><p><strong>Control</strong> the request producer</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><h3><strong>(Auto-)Scaling</strong></h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Probably, is the easiest way to deal with the problem. E.g. in the example above the solution would be to scale the <strong>service B</strong> up - this definitely will resolve throughput deficit. In some cases this will be just enough, but in other - auto-scaling might lead to propagating the problem to the next service (e.g. <strong>service C</strong>). Also, if you are in severe cost/hardware deficit, scaling up is simply not feasible.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3><strong>Dropping down or sampling</strong></h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Only some fraction of incoming requests is processed, other are simply ignoring. E.g. in the example above to solve the problem it would be enough for <strong>service B</strong> to just skip processing every 3rd request. However, most often it&#8217;s not applicable in practice</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3><strong>Buffering</strong> requests</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Probably, is the most intuitive thing to do. E.g. in the example above this approach can be implemented by introducing messaging queue between <strong>service A and B</strong> or, alternatively, storing incoming request to the database. This, in essence, allows <strong>service B</strong> to pull requests when it&#8217;s ready to process them. However, beside the complication in infrastructure it&#8217;s not always possible, since not all requests might be processed asynchronously.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3><strong>Controlling producer</strong></h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Controlling the request producer is actually what is defined as "back-pressure" by Reactive Manifesto. In the example above it means that <strong>service B</strong> should be able to slow down/speed up <strong>service A</strong>. So, <strong>service A</strong> should not <em>push</em> requests to <strong>service B</strong>, instead <strong>service B</strong> should <em>pull</em> desired number of requests from <strong>service A</strong>. However, controlling producer speed is not always an option (imaging telling your user to slow down). Also, back-pressure mechanism introduces complexity in the system, so should be decided carefully.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Conclusion</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Whenever there is a mismatch in throughput between services there might be the opportunity to apply back-pressure pattern.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>What strategy should be applied really depends on the constraints and requirements at hand.</p></div></div></div>]]></content>
