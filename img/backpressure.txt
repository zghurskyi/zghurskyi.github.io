Service A-#red>Service B: 150 req/sec

activate Service B
Service B-#blue>Service C: 100 req/sec
deactivate Service B

note over Service A,Service C:If service A sends 150 req/sec to server B,\nbut server B can only process 100 req/sec,\nthen there is 50 req/sec deficit.\nSo after 1 hour of working,\nthere are 180000 reqeuests to be dealt somehow!
