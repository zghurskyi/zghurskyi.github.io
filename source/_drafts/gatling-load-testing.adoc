Sooner or later, there comes the time to measure how your RESTful service behaves under load.
There are many of the shelf tools, that allow to do this in "quick-and-dirty" way --
like {wrk-reference-url}[wrk]/{wrk2-reference-url}[wrk2], {apache-benchmark-reference-url}[ab], etc.
However, if you're working with JVM and want to setup reproducible and comprehensive load testing,
probably, the best tool would be {gatling-reference-url}[Gatling].

This post is `how-to` article for setting up load testing of Spring Boot service with Gatling.

In this post we will do the following:

. Setup simple reactive web-service with POST and GET endpoints
. Configure Maven to support Gatling
. Write simple load testing scenario for our endpoints

Without further ado -- let's start!
