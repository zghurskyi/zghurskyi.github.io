Back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than collapse under it.
The back-pressure may cascade all the way up to the user, at which point responsiveness may degrade, but this mechanism will ensure that the system is resilient under load.

== Back-Pressure

This is how it's defined in {backpressure-glossary-url}[Reactive Manifesto]:

[quote]
____
*Back-Pressure*

When one component is struggling to keep-up, the system as a whole needs
to respond in a sensible way. It is unacceptable for the component under
stress to fail catastrophically or to drop messages in an uncontrolled
fashion. Since it can’t cope and it can’t fail it should communicate the
fact that it is under stress to upstream components and so get them to
reduce the load. This back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism
that allows systems to gracefully respond to load rather than collapse
under it. The back-pressure may cascade all the way up to the user, at
which point responsiveness may degrade, but this mechanism will ensure
that the system is resilient under load, and will provide information
that may allow the system itself to apply other resources to help
distribute the load.

Let's illustrate the context, that requires to apply back-pressure.

So, essentially the problem here is the mismatch in throughput between
services.

== Strategies to deal with throughput mismatch

Once you are in the situation described above, essentially you have
following choices:

* *(Auto-)Scale* service, that is under pressure
* *Drop down or sample* incoming requests, once service under pressure
is saturated
* *Buffer* requests
* *Control* the request producer

=== *(Auto-)Scaling*

Probably, is the easiest way to deal with the problem.
E.g. in the example above the solution would be to scale the
*service B* up - this definitely will resolve throughput deficit. In some cases this
will be just enough, but in other - auto-scaling might lead to 
propagating the problem to the next service (e.g. *service C*). Also, if
you are in severe cost/hardware deficit, scaling up is simply not feasible.

=== *Dropping down or sampling*

Only some fraction of incoming requests is processed, other are simply ignoring.
E.g. in the example above to solve the problem it would be enough for *service B* to
just skip processing every 3rd request. However, most often it's not
applicable in practice

=== *Buffering* requests

Probably, is the most intuitive thing to do. E.g. in
the example above this approach can be implemented by introducing
messaging queue between *service A and B* or, alternatively, storing
incoming request to the database. This, in essence, allows *service B* to
pull requests when it's ready to process them. However, beside the
complication in infrastructure it's not always possible, since not
all requests might be processed asynchronously.

=== *Controlling producer*

Controlling the request producer is actually what is defined as
"back-pressure" by Reactive Manifesto. In the example above it means
that *service B* should be able to slow down/speed up *service A*. So,
*service A* should not _push_ requests to *service B*, instead
*service B* should _pull_ desired number of requests from *service A*.
However, controlling producer speed is not always an option
(imaging telling your user to slow down). Also, back-pressure mechanism introduces
complexity in the system, so should be decided carefully.

== Conclusion

Whenever there is a mismatch in throughput between services there might
be the opportunity to apply back-pressure pattern.

What strategy should be applied really depends on the constraints and
requirements at hand.
