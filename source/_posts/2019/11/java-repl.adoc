In this post I provide a tutorial on using awesome `jshell` tool.

== Motivation

There are many times, when you just want to try out some code snippet in Java.
For example, you want to experiment with new constructs available in recent Java versions, something like `var`.

For a long time, to do this you had to follow `Write-Compile-Execute Loop`:

* write the Java program (of course with `public static void main(String... args)`)

* compile written code with `javac` (and potentially fix the problems)

* execute compiled byte-code with `java`

* if something is wrong -- edit written program and repeat the process

The frustrating thing here is unnecessary delay between the time you got an idea for your experiment
and the time you actually got the feedback from Java compiler/runtime.

But luckily for us -- now we have a tool, that finally removes unnecessary hustle. Please, meet `jshell`!

`jshell` significantly shortens the feedback loop -- thus increasing your productivity.
The boost is achieved by removing the need to switch back and forth between your editor/IDE and shell.
Specifically, `jshell` implements `Read-Evaluate-Print Loop`:

* reads your snippets from command line

* evaluates the given code

* quickly prints the result back to you

If you think about it -- this is pretty awesome!

Hopefully at this point you're eager to play with `jshell`, so, without further ado -- let's start.

== Starting / exiting `jshell`

== Writing code snippets

== `jshell` commands

== Editing

== Feedback modes

== Conclusion

`jshell` doesn't replace IDEs. The tool is there for you to learn and experiment with Java code.

`jshell` provides very convenient and safe playground.
So, you can try different ideas and, after getting satisfactory results, just copy final code into your program editor or IDE.

Overall, in my opinion, `jshell` significantly shortens the feedback loop -- thus increasing your productivity.
The boost is achieved by removing the need to switching back and forth between your editor/IDE and shell.
