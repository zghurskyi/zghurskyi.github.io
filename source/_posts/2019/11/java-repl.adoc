In this post I provide a tutorial on using awesome `jshell` tool.

== Motivation

There are many times, when you just want to try out some code snippet in Java.
For example, you want to experiment with new constructs available in recent Java versions, something like `var`.

For a long time, to do this you had to follow `Write-Compile-Execute Loop`:

* write the Java program (of course with `public static void main(String... args)`)

* compile written code with `javac` (and potentially fix compile-time errors)

* execute compiled byte-code with `java` (and potentially fix run-time exceptions)

* edit written program and repeat the process

The frustrating thing here is delay between the time you start writing code
and the time you actually got the feedback from Java compiler/runtime.
However, now we have a tool, that finally removes unnecessary hustle. Please, meet `jshell`!

`jshell` significantly shortens the feedback loop -- thus increasing your productivity.
The boost is achieved by eliminating the need to switch back and forth between your editor/IDE and shell,
since you write Java code in the dedicated shell (hence the name, `jshell`).
More precisely, `jshell` implements `Read-Evaluate-Print Loop`:

* reads the code from command line

* evaluates the given snippet

* prints the result back to you

If you think about it -- this is pretty awesome!

Hopefully at this point you're eager to play with `jshell`, so, without further ado -- let's start.

== Starting / exiting `jshell`

* Using JDK 9+

`jshell` is available on JDK 9+ and above. So, if you have one of the recent Java versions available in the `$PATH`,
then all you need to do is simply launch `jshell`:

[source,shell script]
----
$ jshell -v
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.4
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> /exit
|  Goodbye
----

NOTE: `-v` flag -- enables verbose feedback mode, that gives you a log of comments from `jshell`.

* Using Docker

If you want to experiment with most recent features of Java in clean and safe playground -- then just use Docker:

[source,shell script]
----
$ docker run --rm -it adoptopenjdk/openjdk13 jshell -v
Nov 03, 2019 12:08:49 AM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences$1 run
INFO: Created user preferences directory.
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 13
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> /exit
|  Goodbye
----

NOTE: `/exit` -- quites `jshell`.

== Snippets

As already mentioned, the `jshell` tool allows you to execute Java code, getting immediate results.
You can enter:

* Java definition (variable, method, class, etc), like:

 int x = 8

* Java expression, like:

  x + x

* Java statement or import, like:

  import java.time

These little chunks of Java code are called `snippets`.

Let's try write a few snippets to get familiar:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> 1 + 1
$1 ==> 2
|  created scratch variable $1 : int

jshell> int n = 1 + 1
n ==> 2
|  created variable n : int

jshell> String hello(String g) {
   ...>   return "hello " + g;
   ...> }
|  created method hello(String)

jshell> String hello(String name) {
   ...>   return "Hi " + name + "!";
   ...> }
|  modified method hello(String)
|    update overwrote method hello(String) <1>

jshell> hello("Alina")
$5 ==> "Hi Alina!"
|  created scratch variable $5 : String

jshell> String n
n ==> null
|  replaced variable n : String
|    update overwrote variable n : int <2>

jshell> double volume(double radius) {
   ...>   return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius); <3>
   ...> }
|  created method volume(double), however, it cannot be invoked until variable PI, and method cube(double) are declared

jshell> double PI = 3.14159

jshell> volume(1)
|  attempted to call method volume(double) which cannot be invoked until method cube(double) is declared

jshell> double cube(double a) { return a * a * a; }

jshell> volume(1)
$11 ==> 4.188786666666666

jshell> int divide(int a, int b) {
   ...>   return a / b;
   ...> }

jshell> divide(1, 0)
|  Exception java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
|        at divide (#12:2) <4>
|        at (#13:1)

jshell> /list <5>

   1 : 1 + 1
   4 : String hello(String name) {
         return "Hi " + name + "!";
       }
   5 : hello("Alina")
   6 : String n;
   7 : double volume(double radius) {
         return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius);
       }
   8 : double PI = 3.14159;
   9 : volume(1)
  10 : double cube(double a) { return a * a * a; }
  11 : volume(1)
  12 : int divide(int a, int b) {
         return a / b;
       }
  13 : divide(1, 0)

----

<1> overwrite existing variable/method/class definition

<2> overwrite existing variable/method/class definition using incompatible type

<3> forward reference variables/methods/classes, that are not yet defined

<4> `#id:line-number` snippet id and line number withing a snippet, that caused an exception

<5> `/list` command to trace back the source of exception

[TIP]
====
Verbose mode gives a lot of commentary, that might be useful, when you just start learning about `jshell`.
When you gained enough experience, just change the feedback level:

`/set feedback` -- displays the current mode and available modes

`/set feedback concise` -- for terse commentary

`/set feedback normal` -- for normal commentary

`/set feedback silent` -- disables all feedback except errors
====

`jshell` supports auto-completion with `<Tab>` key:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> "hello". [Tab] <1>
charAt(                chars()                codePointAt(
codePointBefore(       codePointCount(        codePoints()
compareTo(             compareToIgnoreCase(   concat(
contains(              contentEquals(         describeConstable()
endsWith(              equals(                equalsIgnoreCase(
formatted(             getBytes(              getChars(
getClass()             hashCode()             indent(
indexOf(               intern()               isBlank()
isEmpty()              lastIndexOf(           length()
lines()                matches(               notify()
notifyAll()            offsetByCodePoints(    regionMatches(
repeat(                replace(               replaceAll(
replaceFirst(          resolveConstantDesc(   split(
startsWith(            strip()                stripIndent()
stripLeading()         stripTrailing()        subSequence(
substring(             toCharArray()          toLowerCase(
toString()             toUpperCase(           transform(
translateEscapes()     trim()                 wait(

jshell> "hello".startsWith( [Tab+Tab] <2>

jshell> "hello".startsWith("h") [Shift+Tab v] <3>

jshell> boolean _ = "hello".startsWith("h") <4>

----

<1> press kbd:[Tab] key to auto-complete

<2> press kbd:[Tab] two times to show text documentation

<3> press kbd:[Shift + Tab + v] to declare the variable with already entered value

<4> after pressing kbd:[Shift + Tab + v], the cursor is placed in the line, where you need to enter variable name
[TIP]
====
`/help shortcuts` -- displays information about available shortcuts

kbd:[Shift + Tab] then kbd:[v] -- the expression will be converted to a variable declaration

kbd:[Shift + Tab] then kbd:[m] -- the expression or statement will be converted to a method declaration

kbd:[Shift + Tab] then kbd:[i] -- propose possible imports
====

== Commands

`jshell` commands control the environment and display information.

Command are distinguished from snippets by a leading forward slash `/`.

Probably, the most useful is `/help` command -- it shows a list of available commands.
Also, it allows to dig dipper into specific command. For example:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /help /var
|
|                                   /vars
|                                   =====
|
|  List the type, name, and value of variables that were entered.
|
|  /vars
|  	List the type, name, and value of the current active variables
|
|  /vars <name>
|  	List variables with the specified name (preference for active variables)
|
|  /vars <id>
|  	List the variable with the specified snippet ID.
|  	One or more IDs or ID ranges may used, see '/help id'
|
|  /vars -start
|  	List the variables in the evaluated startup snippets
|
|  /vars -all
|  	List all variables including failed, overwritten, dropped, and startup
----

`jshell` has a default startup script that is silently and automatically executed before start, so that you can get to work quickly.
Entries from the startup script aren't listed unless you request them with the `/list -start` or `/list -all` command:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /list -all

  s1 : import java.io.*;
  s2 : import java.math.*;
  s3 : import java.net.*;
  s4 : import java.nio.file.*;
  s5 : import java.util.*;
  s6 : import java.util.concurrent.*;
  s7 : import java.util.function.*;
  s8 : import java.util.prefs.*;
  s9 : import java.util.regex.*;
 s10 : import java.util.stream.*;
----

[TIP]
====
The default startup script consists of several common imports.

`/set start` command, can be used to personalize your startup entries (for more details, use `/help /set start`).

`/save -start` command saves personalized startup script.
====

Similar to snippet completion, when you enter commands and command options,
use the kbd:[Tab] key to automatically complete the command or option.

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /
/!          /?          /drop       /edit       /env        /exit
/help       /history    /imports    /list       /methods    /open
/reload     /reset      /save       /set        /types      /vars

<press tab again to see synopsis>
----

[TIP]
====
Yet another useful way to get help, is to press kbd:[Tab] second time, to see synopsis for specific command:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /env -
view or change the evaluation context

<press tab again to see full documentation>
----

====

Using kbd:[Tab] in a file argument position of the command shows the available files:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /open
.dockerenv   /            bin/         boot/        dev/         etc/
home/        lib/         lib64/       media/       mnt/         opt/
proc/        root/        run/         sbin/        srv/         sys/
tmp/         usr/         var/

<press tab again to see synopsis>

----

Command (and command option) abbreviations are supported, **as long as the abbreviation is unique**.

For example, the only command that begins with `/l` is `/list`, and the only `/list` option that begins with `-a` is `-all`.
Therefore, you can use the following abbreviations to enter the `/list -all` command:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /l -a
----

== Search

By pressing kbd:[up arrow] / kbd:[down arrow] you can navigate through the history of entered items.

However, sometimes it's pretty tedious to go through history one line at a time.
So, to perform backward history search -- use kbd:[Ctrl+R]:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell>
bck-i-search: _
----

Now, you can enter keyword to search for (e.g. `class` -- if you want to search for all previously defined classes).
You can continue go further back history by repeatedly pressing kbd:[Ctrl+R].
And if at some point you want to move the search forward towards the present -- use kbd:[Ctrl+S].

== External editor

An alternative to editing at the command prompt is to use an external editor.
This editor can be used to edit and create snippets, and is especially helpful for multiline snippets.

To edit a specific snippet in an editor, use `/edit` command with snippet name or id.
Use `/list` command to get snippet id.

You can configure `jshell` to use the editor of your choice with the `/set editor` command:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell> /set editor vim
|  Editor set to: vim

jshell> /edit
----

Now, you can define multi-line snippet in external editor, and after saving and closing editor,
`jshell` prompt is restored:

[source,shell script]
----
jshell>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you don’t specify an editor, then the following environment variables are checked in order:
JSHELLEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR.
If none of those are set, then a simple default editor is used.
====

== Conclusion

`jshell` doesn't replace IDEs. The tool is there for you to learn and experiment with Java code.

`jshell` provides very convenient and safe playground.
So, you can try different ideas and, after getting satisfactory results, just copy final code into your program editor or IDE.

Overall, in my opinion, `jshell` significantly shortens the feedback loop -- thus increasing your productivity.
The boost is achieved by removing the need to switching back and forth between your editor/IDE and shell.
