The Decorator pattern is handy tool in every developer toolbox.
Probably, every developer used the pattern and knows when and how to apply it.
However, in this post we will look at this pattern from two different points of view (Object-Oriented and Functional)
and compare the approaches.

== What this post about ?

* Decorator in Object Oriented Light

* Decorator in Functional light

* Comparison and Results

So, without further ado -- let's get started.

== Why might you use Decorator pattern ?

In object-oriented design Decorator pattern is used:

. To attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
+
NOTE: It enables fine granularity in distributing functionality between objects,
which basically is very good example of applying Single Responsibility Principle.

. To add behavior to an individual object,
without affecting the behavior of other objects.
+
NOTE: Decorator is one of the patterns, that demonstrates the Open/Closed Principle very clearly.

== Toy problem

To get better grasp of the pattern let's use it for the following task:

Imagine, that weâ€™re required to develop a annual net salary calculator.
So, given gross annual salary, we should find net salary after applying series of taxes.

Of course, the task is very simple, and one may object, that we are over-engineering.
However, this is deliberate decision made for demonstration purposes.

== Conclusion
