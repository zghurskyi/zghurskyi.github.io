The `Decorator pattern` is handy tool in every developer toolbox.
Probably, everyone occasionally uses this pattern and knows when and how to apply it.
Nevertheless, in this post I will show how to implement decorator in functional style,
and contrast it with object-oriented way.

== Why might you use `Decorator pattern` ?

Let's start by highlighting the reasons `Decorator pattern` might be useful in your everyday programming practice.

Shortly put, in Object-Oriented Design (OOD) `Decorator pattern` is used:

. To attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
+
NOTE: It enables fine granularity in distributing functionality between objects,
which basically is very good example of applying {single-responsibility-principle-url}[Single Responsibility Principle].

. To add behavior to an object, without affecting the behavior of collaborating objects.
+
NOTE: Decorator is one of the patterns, that demonstrates the {open-closed-principle-url}[Open/Closed Principle] very clearly.

== Toy problem

To get better grasp of the pattern let's use it for the following task:

Imagine, that weâ€™re required to develop a monthly net salary calculator,
given gross annual salary, after applying series of taxes.

Of course, the task is very simple, and one may argue, that we are over-engineering.
However, this is deliberate decision made for demonstration purposes.

== Decorator in Object-Oriented Light

We will start by designing an interface for our calculator:

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public interface SalaryCalculator {
    double calculate(double grossAnnual);
}
----

The next step, is to implement default calculator, that just finds average monthly salary:

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public class DefaultSalaryCalculator implements SalaryCalculator {

    @Override
    public double calculate(double grossAnnual) {
        return grossAnnual / 12;
    }
}
----

Then, following classical definition, we will introduce `AbstractTaxDecorator`,
that will allow us to apply different taxes as decorations of `DefaultSalaryCalculator`.

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public abstract class AbstractTaxDecorator implements SalaryCalculator {

    private final SalaryCalculator salaryCalculator;

    public AbstractTaxDecorator(SalaryCalculator salaryCalculator) {
        this.salaryCalculator = salaryCalculator;
    }

    protected abstract double applyTax(double salary);

    @Override
    public final double calculate(double gross) {
        double salary = salaryCalculator.calculate(gross);
        return applyTax(salary);
    }

}
----

Next, let's add several tax decorators:

* Social security tax:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public class SocialSecurityTaxDecorator extends AbstractTaxDecorator {

    public SocialSecurityTaxDecorator(SalaryCalculator salaryCalculator) {
        super(salaryCalculator);
    }

    @Override
    protected double applyTax(double salary) {
        return salary * 0.22;
    }
}
----

* Military tax:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public class MilitaryTaxDecorator extends AbstractTaxDecorator {

    public MilitaryTaxDecorator(SalaryCalculator salaryCalculator) {
        super(salaryCalculator);
    }

    @Override
    protected double applyTax(double salary) {
        return salary * 0.015;
    }
}
----

Finally, we can use everything together:
[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.object_oriented;

public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double netSalary = new MilitaryTaxDecorator(
                new SocialSecurityTaxDecorator(
                    new DefaultSalaryCalculator()
                )
        ).calculate(60000.00);
    }
}
----

Ok, this is well and good, let's now take a look at a little bit different approach.

== Decorator in Functional Light

As with OOD approach, we will start with defining the calculator interface:

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.functional;

import java.util.Objects;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface SalaryCalculator {

    double calculate(double grossAnnual);

    default SalaryCalculator andThen(SalaryCalculator after) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(after);
        return (double amount) -> after.calculate(calculate(amount));
    }
}
----

As you already noticed, the interface differs a bit from object-oriented counterpart:

* we have added `andThen` method, that actually gives us ability
to dynamically compose instances of `SalaryCalculator`.
* moreover, `SalaryCalculator` is marked as {functional-interface-javadoc-url}[@FunctionalInterface],
which simply means that we'll be able to use lambdas instead of decorator classes

We can leave `DefaultSalaryCalculator` without any changes.
However, let's define `Taxes` class, that encapsulates all possible taxes:

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.functional;

public final class Taxes {

    private Taxes() {}

    public static double socialSecurityTax(double salary) {
        return salary * 0.22;
    }

    public static double militaryTax(double salary) {
        return salary * 0.015;
    }
}
----

And, finally, let's put everything together:

[source,java]
----
package com.oxymorus.decorator.functional;

public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double netSalary = new DefaultSalaryCalculator()
                .andThen(Taxes::socialSecurityTax)
                .andThen(Taxes::militaryTax)
                .calculate(60000.00);
    }
}
----

== Comparison and Results

Comparing two implementations, we can conclude:

* Both approaches solve the problem
* Functional is far more concise
* Object-Oriented is verbose and adds accidental complexity, but emphasizes Single Responsibility & Open Closed Principles
