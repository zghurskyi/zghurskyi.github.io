== Introduction

{optimistic-locking-reference-url}[Optimistic locking] is general pattern commonly used
to maintain data consistency.

In this post I will describe how to implement optimistic locking with No-SQL storage, that has reactive client.

== Aerospike `generation` meta-data

In traditional RDBMS to implement optimistic locking one would have to introduce
additional `version` or `timestamp` column.

In case of Aerospike, required data is available by default: each record has `generation` meta-data.
So, in order to fail, when record is updated/deleted concurrently, one would need only enable
`GenerationPolicy.EXPECT_GEN_EQUAL`:

[source,java]
----
ClientPolicy clientPolicy = new ClientPolicy();
clientPolicy.writePolicyDefault.generationPolicy = GenerationPolicy.EXPECT_GEN_EQUAL;
----

Having above config in place ensures that update/delete will be executed successfully,
if expected generation is equal to server generation, otherwise, update/delete will fail.


== Reactor `retryWhen` operation

{project-reactor-url}[Project Reactor] is a fourth-generation Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on
the JVM based on the {reactive-streams-jvm-url}[Reactive Streams Specification].

In the context of our goal, we will use {retry-when-javadoc-url}[retryWhen] operation:

== Implementation

Now let's put everything together and write method that performs `createOrUpdate` operation on `Data` instance:

[source,java]
----
public Mono<Data> createOrUpdate(Data data) {

    return Mono.defer(() -> doCreateOrUpdate(data))
            .retryWhen(Retries.optimisticLockException(retryProperties)
                    .doOnRetry(context -> log.warn("Retrying optimistic failure for data", data, context.exception()))
            );
}

private Mono<Data> doCreateOrUpdate(Data data) {

    return repository.findDataByKey(data.getKey())
            .map(existingData -> data.withGeneration(existingData.getGeneration()))
            .flatMap(existingData -> repository.createOrUpdate(existingData).map(Functions.constant(existingData)));
}
----

== Conclusion

Implementing optimistic locking with Aerospike and Reactor is pretty straight-forward.
Since all tools are already in place, all that needs to be done - put everything together.
