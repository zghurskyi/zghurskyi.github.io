"Service A"->"Service B": 150 req/sec
"Service B"->"Service C": 100 req/sec

note over "Service A","Service C":If service A sends 150 req/sec to server B,\nbut server B can only process 100 req/sec,\nthen there is 50 req/sec deficit.\n\nSo, after 1 hour of working,\nthere are 180000 reqeuests to be dealt somehow!
