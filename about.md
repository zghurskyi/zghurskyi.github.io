I am Oleksii Zghurskyi: Software Engineer with around 5 years of software development experience. I'm primarily interested in design, development, testing and support of Java-based applications.

I have practical experience with wide range of technologies and tools, including:
- Application frameworks (Spring: Core, Boot, MVC, Data, Cache, Scheduling, JMS;
Play Framework)
- Databases: relational (MySQL, Oracle) and non-relational (Cassandra)
- Web services (REST and SOAP)
- Messaging with JMS (Tibco, IBM MQ, ActiveMQ) and Apache Kafka
- SCM tools (Git, SVN)
- Build tools (Maven, Gradle)
